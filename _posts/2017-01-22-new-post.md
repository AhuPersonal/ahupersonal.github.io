Data science for me was just a field to extract knowledge and insight from data. You could do fantastic(!) things for your company like making predictions for the next years' sales or recommending a new movie to your customer! I knew that the market was paying much for this kind of job and I should have started from somewhere for a career change. But somehow, it was sounding boring and I was dragging my feet until last April.  It was one of those mornings when I saw the news about bringing back the master from 17th-century to life again to create his new piece of work. And wow! What was it? As a data science career candidate, I was attracted to the topic...

+Rembrandt van Rijn (1606 – 1669) was one of the world’s greatest painters and an important figure in Dutch history.
[Rembrandt van Rijn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt), famed Dutch artist, was no longer alive but over 150,000 fragments were taken from his body of work to comprise his new painting. I was aware of the power of the big data but this was something different. This is art and how could a program imitate an artist indistinguishably?

The team worked tirelessly to anyalyze all known works of Rembrandt, which amounts to over 300 paintings, using high resolution 3D scans to capture every little detail and create an algorithm that would eventually be able to accurately recreate his style. That data was then fed to a 3D printer, which recreated the painting using 13 layers of paint-based UV ink.


## Step 1: Gathering the Data

![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Rembrandt.gif){: .align-right}

It’s been almost four centuries since the world lost the talent of one its most influential classical painters, Rembrandt van Rijn. To bring him back, we distilled the artistic DNA from his work and used it to create The Next Rembrandt.

We examined the entire collection of Rembrandt’s work, studying the contents of his paintings pixel by pixel. To get this data, we analyzed a broad range of materials like high resolution 3D scans and digital files, which were upscaled by deep learning algorithms to maximize resolution and quality. This extensive database was then used as the foundation for creating The Next Rembrandt.



## Step 2: Determining the subject

Replace `gem "github-pages` or `gem "jekyll"` with `gem "jekyll", "~> 3.3.0"`. You'll need the latest version of Jekyll[^update-jekyll] for Minimal Mistakes to work and load all of the /assets/ properly.

[^update-jekyll]: You could also run `bundle update jekyll` to update Jekyll.

Add the Minimal Mistakes theme gem: 

```ruby
gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"
```

When finished your `Gemfile` should look something like this:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "jekyll", "~> 3.3.0"
gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"
```

## Step 3: Generating the feature

Run `bundle install` (or `bundle update` if you're updating an existing repo) to install/update Jekyll and the theme.

## Step 4: Bringing it to life

Add `theme: "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"` to your `_config.yml` file.

If you're migrating from an existing Minimal Mistakes site you shouldn't have to change anything else after this. If it's a new site consult then docs to [properly config]({{ "/docs/configuration/" | absolute_url }}).

**Please Note:** Paths for image headers, overlays, teasers, [galleries]({{ "/docs/helpers/#gallery" | absolute_url }}), and [feature rows]({{ "/docs/helpers/#feature-row" | absolute_url }}) have changed and now require a full path. Instead of just `image: filename.jpg` you'll need to use the full path eg: `image: assets/images/filename.jpg`. The preferred location is now `assets/images` but can be placed elsewhere or external hosted. This all applies for image references in `_config.yml` and `author.yml` as well.

## Step 5: `jekyll new` Tweaks

If this is a new site be sure to add the following files to `_data/` and customize as you see fit. There is currently no way of bundling them in with the theme, so be sure to consult the docs on how to properly use both.

- [`_data/ui-text.yml`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_data/ui-text.yml) - UI text [documentation]({{ "/docs/ui-text/" | absolute_url }})
- [`_data/navigation.yml`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml) - navigation [documentation]({{ "/docs/navigation/" | absolute_url }})

You'll also need to: 

- Replace `<site root>/index.html` with a modified [Minimal Mistakes `index.html`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/index.html).
- Change `layout: post` in `_posts/0000-00-00-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown` to `layout: single`.
- Remove `about.md`, or at the very least change `layout: page` to `layout: single` and remove references to `icon-github.html` (or [copy to your `_includes`](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master/_includes) if using).

---

That's it! If all goes well running `bundle exec jekyll serve` should spin-up your site. If you encounter any bumps please file an issue on GitHub and make sure to indicate you're testing the pre-release Ruby gem version.
