Data science was just a field to extract knowledge and insight from data to me. You could do fantastic(!) things for your company like making predictions for the next years' sales or recommending a new movie to your customer! I knew that the market was paying much for this kind of job and I should have started from somewhere for a career change. But somehow, it was sounding boring and I was dragging my feet until last April.  It was one of those mornings when I saw the news about bringing back the master from 17th-century to life again to create his new piece of work. What was it? As a data science career candidate, it caught my attention.

{% include toc title="Getting Started" %}

[Rembrandt van Rijn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt), one of the world’s greatest painters, was no longer alive but over 150,000 fragments were taken from his body of work to make his new painting. I was aware of the power of the big data but this was something different. It was art and how could a program imitate the style of the artist indistinguishably? Could you see the difference? It is claimed that a program would behave like a person amd perform *art* in his style. The definition of [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art) is obvious. It should be **imaginative** and it requires **emotional power**. I was suprised to hear that data would be used to imitate soul. To be honest, many possible innovation based on this algorithm came to my mind within seconds and I decided to learn data science to be involved in these kind of projects.

If you could watch the video, you saw that this data-engineered art was created by using  
  - deep machine learning algorithms  
  - 3D scans of the artist's existings paintings  
  - 3D printer   
  
The team (*ING Bank, Microsoft, Delft University of Technology*) behind this 18-month project performed a collaborative work. ING initialized it, Microsoft provided a reliable platform to analyze the data and Delft was responsible for the input. 346 paintings were analyzed in detailed to determine the new subject to take place in the new painting. It was pure data analysis determining the proportion of the shapes of the subject's features. At this point, **deep machine learning algorithms** were used to recreate his style accurately. Computed data was then turned into the 3d printer crafted masterpiece and finally they won the [Cyber Lions Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Lions_International_Festival_of_Creativity)

## Step 1: Where did the idea come from?

The backstory is so simple. The innovative creative director, Bas Korsten, of [JWS Amsterdam](http://jwt.amsterdam/en/home) takes a brief from another Dutch company, ING, about innovation, technology and art. After a brain-storming session,  a topic from an archeology article was discussed. Jesus face was created by means of the skulls found from those times. If creating something new from historical material is possible, they thought that this could be applied to art as well. This is how the idea was born in Amsterdam and ended up choosing Rembrandt wisely because he was an important figure for Netherlands. Besides, he was *one of the best documented painters ever*. This is reasonable because we know that more data matters from the perspective of the [large sample theory](http://people.hss.caltech.edu/~mshum/stats/lect5.pdf).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
If they could feed the program with enough data, it could learn how to paint like its owner and create a new portrait. Because this was a challenging work, a team full of **data scientists, ML experts, engineers** and **art historians** was built to start this ambitious idea.

## Step 2: Gathering the Data

[The original website](https://www.nextrembrandt.com/) of the project explains this part in detail. We all know that machine learning algorithms learn with data. Here, the data was the source of the creativity. The high resolution 3D scans captured every piece of content, pixel by pixel. Algorithms upscaled the milimetric details and mapped the characteristics such as *eyes, noses, widths, depths, brush strokes* and *canvas quality*. It is always the data taking most of the time to be cleaned before the analysis. Considering how big the data they used, this period took months for the project. In the end, the analysis showed that new portrait should be **a person from Caucasia, wearing dark clothes, a man with facial hair** and **between 30 and 40 years old.**

## Step 3: Generating the feature

At this step, they used facial recognition algorithm and the program learned the style of the artist. Typical geometic patterns by his brush were recognized from the training data. 60 points could be detected by this algorithm. The distances between these points were determined on the face. It could then use the learned principles and create new painting for the test data. [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us)'s secure platform was used to make the analysis. 150 gigabytes of digitally rendered graphics used to create the final portait. Microsoft clarified the working processes from its original [website](http://news.microsoft.com/europe/features/the-next-rembrandt-blurring-the-lines-between-art-technology-and-emotion-2/#sm.0001gcd6kq14x6ey5r88rnfrkgk06#9L8zoEAbkFEUeUMP.97) as the following:  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
> The algorithm used to analyze the Rembrandt paintings ran [Linux virtual machines](https://www.linux.com/learn/why-when-and-how-use-virtual-machine) (VM) on Microsoft Azure, giving developers enormous flexibility. They could quickly and easily switch between the cloud, used when extreme computing power was required, and on premise, to work on the algorithm with small amounts of the data and to render the final product. Azure batch services made it possible to use the algorithm up to 1,000 times in parallel.

## Step 4: Bringing it to life  

Once they calculated the Rembrandt's use of proportions, the features previously determined formed the new face of the new portrait. 
The University created the height map to understand the topography- the height of the brush strokes off the canvas.

> "Brush strokes means the layering of material. Geometry means how it looks. We needed to split all these components into smaller processes, because it was way too complex."

For now, the codes are not open-source but we know that the team is working on this. Here the main idea is that the algorithm didn't take the average of the features to create the final portrait. Instead, it identified the patterns and created new features. That is to say, it imitated the soul.

## Step 5: A brand new area?  

Although this pseudo-creativity brought along many controversial discussions, I think this will inspire people to explore the data more. When I first heard about this project, I just thought about how the paintings evolved into photography and movie as technology advances. I think if algorithms can learn this and touch our real life so closely as in this case, there is no reason not to make a film once fed with enough data. I believe that the development in the web clouding and machine learning fields will break the chains and accelarate the progress of creative algorithms.
