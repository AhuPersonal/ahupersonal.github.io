{% include toc title="Getting Started" %}

Data science for me was just a field to extract knowledge and insight from data. You could do fantastic(!) things for your company like making predictions for the next years' sales or recommending a new movie to your customer! I knew that the market was paying much for this kind of job and I should have started from somewhere for a career change. But somehow, it was sounding boring and I was dragging my feet until last April.  It was one of those mornings when I saw the news about bringing back the master from 17th-century to life again to create his new piece of work. And wow! What was it? As a data science career candidate, I was attracted to the topic...

[Rembrandt van Rijn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt), one of the world’s greatest painters, was no longer alive but over 150,000 fragments were taken from his body of work to comprise his new painting. I was aware of the power of the big data but this was something different. It was art and how could a program imitate an artist indistinguishably?

If you could watch the video, you saw that this data-engineered art was created by using  
  + deep machine learning algorithms
  + 3D scans of the artist's existings paintings 
  + 3D printer  
  
The team (ING Bank, Microsoft, Delft University of Technology) behind this 18-month project performed a collaborative work. ING initialized it, Microsoft provided a reliable platform to analyze the data and Delft was responsible for the input data. 346 paintings were analyzed in detailed to determine the new subject to take place in the new painting. It was pure data analysis detemining the proportion of the shapes of the subject's features. At this point, deep algorithms were used to recreate his style accurately. Computed data was then turned into the 3d printer crafted masterpiece. and they won the [Cyber Lions Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Lions_International_Festival_of_Creativity)

## Step 1: Where did the idea come from?

The backstory is so simple. An innovative creative director of an advertising agency from Amsterdam takes a brief from another Dutch company, ING Bank, about innovation, technology and art. After a brain-storming seesion,  a topic from an archeology article was discussed. Jesus face was created by means of the skulls found from those times. If creating something new from historical material is possible, then this could be applied to art as well. This is how the idea was born in Amsterdam and ended up choosing Rembrandt wisely because he was an important figure for Netherlands.

If they could feed the program with enough data, it could learn how to paint like its owner and create a new portrait. Because this was a challenging work, a team full of **data scientists, ML experts, engineers** and **art historians** was built to start this ambitious idea.

## Step 2: Gathering the Data

[The original website](https://www.nextrembrandt.com/) of the project explains the parts in detail. Machine learning algorithms learn with data. Here the data was the source of the creativity. The high resolution 3D scans captured every piece of content, pixel by pixel. Algorithms upscaled the milimetric details and mapped the characteristics such as eyes, noses, widths, depths, brush strokes and canvas quality. It is always the data taking most of the time to be cleaned before the analysis. Considering how big the data they used, this period took months for the project.  



## Step 3: Generating the feature
