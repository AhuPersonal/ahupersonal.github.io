Data science for me was just a field to extract knowledge and insight from data. You could do fantastic(!) things for your company like making predictions for the next years' sales or recommending a new movie to your customer! I knew that the market was paying much for this kind of job and I should have started from somewhere for a career change. But somehow, it was sounding boring and I was dragging my feet until last April.  It was one of those mornings when I saw the news about bringing back the master from 17th-century to life again to create his new piece of work. And wow! What was it? As a data science career candidate, I was attracted to the topic...

+Rembrandt van Rijn (1606 – 1669) was one of the world’s greatest painters and an important figure in Dutch history.
[Rembrandt van Rijn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt), famed Dutch artist, was no longer alive but over 150,000 fragments were taken from his body of work to comprise his new painting. I was aware of the power of the big data but this was something different. This is art and how could a program imitate an artist indistinguishably?

The team worked tirelessly to anyalyze all known works of Rembrandt, which amounts to over 300 paintings, using high resolution 3D scans to capture every little detail and create an algorithm that would eventually be able to accurately recreate his style. That data was then fed to a 3D printer, which recreated the painting using 13 layers of paint-based UV ink.


## Step 1: Gathering the Data

It’s been almost four centuries since the world lost the talent of one its most influential classical painters, Rembrandt van Rijn. To bring him back, we distilled the artistic DNA from his work and used it to create The Next Rembrandt.

We examined the entire collection of Rembrandt’s work, studying the contents of his paintings pixel by pixel. To get this data, we analyzed a broad range of materials like high resolution 3D scans and digital files, which were upscaled by deep learning algorithms to maximize resolution and quality. This extensive database was then used as the foundation for creating The Next Rembrandt.

## Step 2: Determining the subject

Throughout his life, Rembrandt painted a great number of self-portraits, commissioned portraits and group shots, Biblical scenes, and even a few landscapes. He’s known for painting brutally honest and unforgiving portrayals of his subjects, utilizing a limited color palette for facial emphasis, and innovating the use of light and shadows.

“There’s a lot of Rembrandt data available — you have this enormous amount of technical data from all these paintings from various collections. And can we actually create something out of it that looks like Rembrandt? That’s an appealing question.”
- Joris Dik, Technical University Delft

## Step 3: Generating the feature

In creating the new painting, it was imperative to stay accurate to Rembrandt’s unique style. As “The Master of Light and Shadow,” Rembrandt relied on his innovative use of lighting to shape the features in his paintings. By using very concentrated light sources, he essentially created a “spotlight effect” that gave great attention to the lit elements and left the rest of the painting shrouded in shadows. This resulted in some of the features being very sharp and in focus and others becoming soft and almost blurry, an effect that had to be replicated in the new artwork.

## Step 4: Bringing it to life

We now had a digital file true to Rembrandt’s style in content, shapes, and lighting. But paintings aren’t just 2D — they have a remarkable three-dimensionality that comes from brushstrokes and layers of paint. To recreate this texture, we had to study 3D scans of Rembrandt’s paintings and analyze the intricate layers on top of the canvas.  
“We looked at a number of Rembrandt paintings, and we scanned their surface texture, their elemental composition, and what kinds of pigments were used. That’s the kind of information you need if you want to generate a painting by Rembrandt virtually.”
- Joris Dik, Technical University Delft  
USING A HEIGHT MAP
TO PRINT IN 3D
We created a height map using two different algorithms that found texture patterns of canvas surfaces and layers of paint. That information was transformed into height data, allowing us to mimic the brushstrokes used by Rembrandt.

We then used an elevated printing technique on a 3D printer that output multiple layers of paint-based UV ink. The final height map determined how much ink was released onto the canvas during each layer of the printing process. In the end, we printed thirteen layers of ink, one on top of the other, to create a painting texture true to Rembrandt’s style.

## Step 5: `jekyll new` Tweaks

If this is a new site be sure to add the following files to `_data/` and customize as you see fit. There is currently no way of bundling them in with the theme, so be sure to consult the docs on how to properly use both.

- [`_data/ui-text.yml`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_data/ui-text.yml) - UI text [documentation]({{ "/docs/ui-text/" | absolute_url }})
- [`_data/navigation.yml`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml) - navigation [documentation]({{ "/docs/navigation/" | absolute_url }})

You'll also need to: 

- Replace `<site root>/index.html` with a modified [Minimal Mistakes `index.html`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/index.html).
- Change `layout: post` in `_posts/0000-00-00-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown` to `layout: single`.
- Remove `about.md`, or at the very least change `layout: page` to `layout: single` and remove references to `icon-github.html` (or [copy to your `_includes`](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master/_includes) if using).

---

That's it! If all goes well running `bundle exec jekyll serve` should spin-up your site. If you encounter any bumps please file an issue on GitHub and make sure to indicate you're testing the pre-release Ruby gem version.
